# android_with_deeplearning
A project-based Artificial Intelligence and Android.
## description
This is the project for recognizing the handwritten digit on the mobile phone.
The user writes a digit on the mobile screen. Then, the app can be recognized what that digit is.
The project is just simple. But, for recognizing the digit, well-constructed neural network is used in this project. The accuracy of recognizing is reached at 99.5%.
The most important part in this project is to combine this training result of neural network with android project.
## Technical Specifications
This project has the following technical specifications.
* Deep learning
  *	Constructing neural network which recognize the handwritten digit
  *	Paris of train and result data
* Designing the handwritten input on the Android
* Combination of the python deep learning result with Android
  *	Convert keras to tflite
  *	Import tflite file on Android
